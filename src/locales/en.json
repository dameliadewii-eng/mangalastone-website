    "introText": "Andesite Stone is a durable natural stone formed from volcanic activity, belonging to the family of extrusive igneous rocks. Originally named after the Andes Mountains in South America which the world’s longest mountain range. This stone is also abundantly found across Indonesia’s volcanic regions. Renowned for its strength, density, and timeless aesthetic, Andesite Stone is highly resistant to weathering, making it ideal for both interior and exterior applications. It is available in a range of natural colours and textures, with multiple surface finishes to suit diverse design preferences. From modern minimalistic projects to traditional architecture, Andesite Stone offers versatility and enduring beauty for paving, wall cladding, landscaping, and other architectural uses.",
